            <p>My name is Abby Embree, I am currently 22 years old, and I am a student at Indiana University in their MLIS program! I currently live in Des Moines, Iowa and work as a library director in a small town about 30 minutes from where I live.</p>
            <p>At my job as the director, I serve a small rural community so much of my time is spent checking in and out books and locating programs that would interest the rural community I work for. I have been in my position since May of last year.</p>
