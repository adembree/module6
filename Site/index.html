            <p>My name is Abby Embree, I am currently 22 years old, and I am a student at Indiana University in their MLIS program! I currently live in Des Moines, Iowa and work as a library director in a small town about 30 minutes from where I live.</p>
            <p>At my job as the director, I serve a small rural community so much of my time is spent checking in and out books and locating programs that would interest the rural community I work for. I have been in my position since May of last year.</p>
            <p>A fun fact about me are that I am presently training to run a 5k. I have never done something like this before and hope to run it sometime during the summer. Another fun fact is that my favorite colors are purple and green, contrary to what this site shows. Though, I think pink and grey are close contenders. A final fun fact about me is that I am very bad at cooking but pretty good at baking.</p>
