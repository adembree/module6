            <p>I consider myself as somewhat of a jack of all trades, especially when it comes to my hobbies. I find that I like to try new things and because of that, I have picked up and put down multiple hobbies.</p>
            <p>Presently, I would consider my hobbies to be sewing, reading, playing video games, embroidery, knitting, and working out. Out of all of my hobbies, I think playing video games and working out take up most of my time at the moment.</p>
            <p>I only recently started working out as a hobby but I find it very rewarding, equally rewarding as I find video games. I also find working out more rewarding when it is with someone else, which is not something I can say about video games since I prefer to play single player games.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Creation</h2>
            <p>I have created a lot of different sewing projects in the past few years but my favorite one has been my latest one.</p><br>
            <p>My latest sewing project was an overskirt for a dress that I had made for a renaissance faire previously. The skirt itself is made from crushed purple velvet. It is a favorite project because of how simple yet effective it was for the outfit as a whole. It is also very stretchy which has created some fun difficulties like preventing it from curling at the ends because it has been stretched.</p>
