            <h2>The Basics About Birdie</h2>
            <p> Birdie has been my pet cat since June of last year! I got her as an early birthday present/graduation gift for myself since, prior to graduation, I did not have the space or means to care for a pet. I actually found her first via petfinder and, because she looked very similar to her sisters at the shelter, I wasn't sure the cat I got was the one I found on petfinder until I formally adopted her.</p>
            <p>Birdie is a very playful and energetic cat, getting the zoomies when I come home from work every day. She also loves to climb high places so she's a big fan of her very tall cat tower. Birdie is also a cay with a strict routine, neeting to have her food at very specific times of day. She also has the same morning and bedtime routine of laying with me for fifteen minutes before either going to play or going to sleep.</p>
